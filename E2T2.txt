Research and analyze which of the vulnerabilities appear to be related to the code that was deployed for the environment in this project.

1. Logging is not enabled for your S3 buckets.
2. Amazon S3 bucket default encryption is not enabled. 
3. S3 buckets should have policies that require requests to use Secure Socket Layer (SSL).
4. The incoming SSH traffic for the security groups is accessible. The rule is compliant when the IP addresses of the incoming SSH traffic in the security groups are restricted.
5. The default security group for VPC is not closed.
6. The EBS volumes that are in an attached state are not encrypted. 


Bonus - provide recommendations on how to remediate the vulnerabilities.
1. Ensure Amazon S3 bucket have Amazon S3 default encryption enabled or that the S3 bucket policy explicitly denies put-object requests without server side encryption.
2. Ensure that Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS) encryption is enabled by default. The rule is NON_COMPLIANT if the encryption is not enabled.
3. Ensure no security groups allow ingress from 0.0.0.0/0 to port 3389
4. The VPC default security group should not allow inbound and outbound traffic. Ensure the default security group of every VPC restricts all traffic.
5. VPC flow logging should be enabled in all VPCs
6.  Ensure IAM policies are attached only to groups or roles
