# What additional architectural change can be made to reduce the internet facing attack surface of the web application instance.

The web application instance should be created in private subnet, so it'll be safe from internet facing attacks.

# Assuming the IAM permissions for the S3 bucket are still insecure, would creating VPC private endpoints for S3 prevent the unauthorized access to the secrets bucket.

No, since the attack instance got access to ApplicationInstance thru' bruteforce, VPC private endpoints for S3 will not prevent the unauthorized access to secrets bucket.


# Will applying default encryption setting to the s3 buckets encrypt the data that already exists?
Enabling default encryption doesn't change the encryption of objects that are already in the bucket.

# What would happen if the original cloud formation templates are applied to this environment.
It will overide all the fixes I did.
